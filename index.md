# Portfolio

Welcome to my github page. This portfolio highlights some of the software projects that I developed recently. Learn more [about me](https://mquilici.github.io/aboutme).

## Software Design and Engineering
[https://github.com/mquilici/Mobile-Weight-Tracker](https://github.com/mquilici/Mobile-Weight-Tracker)

This is a mobile fitiness app I created for Android. The app enables users to track their weight, plot their weight on a graph, set a goal weight, and compute their BMI. A settings screen provides the ability to change the theme and change units from to english or metric. After entering a height measurment, users will see their current BMI plotted on chart for comparison with standard BMI ranges.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
[https://github.com/mquilici/Java-3D-Shapes](https://github.com/mquilici/Java-3D-Shapes)

This is a Java application I created that draws platonic solids and other 3D objects. The program demonstrates the use of rotation matricies and projection matricies as well as lighting calculations. A binary tree data structure is used to sort polygons by depth so that they can be drawn back to front.

## Databases
[https://github.com/mquilici/Web-Dashboard](https://github.com/mquilici/Web-Dashboard)

This is a web dashboard that uses MongoDB and Plotly Dash to help users find shelter animals. Animals can be sorted by several characteristics using dropdown menus and their location is displayed on a map.

## Computer Graphics

### OpenGL
[https://github.com/mquilici/OpenGL-Demo](https://github.com/mquilici/OpenGL-Demo)

This is an OpenGL program that that demonstrates texture mapping, normal mapping, and shadow mapping techniques. Vertex and fragment shaders apply textures to the objects and compute Phong lighting components (specular, diffuse, and ambient). I wrote an object loader method that imports 3D object files containing vertex coordinates, normal vectors, and UV coordinates for each face.

### OpenGL
[https://github.com/mquilici/Fractal-OpenGL](https://github.com/mquilici/Fractal-OpenGL)

This is an OpenGL program that draws a 3D Mandelbrot fractal. The Mandelbrot set is typically depectied as a 2D image in the complex plane generated by the iterative equation z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c. Depending on the location, the iteration may converge to one value or oscillate between multiple values. To generate a 3D mandelbrot fractal, the z values for the last several iterations are stored in an array for each pixel and then plotted. A interesting result of plotting the data in 3D is that real axis contains a classic bifurcation diagram .

## Cybersecurity
[https://github.com/mquilici/Cybersecurity](https://github.com/mquilici/Cybersecurity)

This is a presentation I created that outlines the cybersecurity policy for a company called Green Pace. The video discusses security vulnerabiltiies, coding best practices, static analysis, unit testing, and security frameworks like defense-in-depth and Triple-A.

## Code Review
[https://github.com/mquilici/Code-Review](https://github.com/mquilici/Code-Review)

This is a code review of my portfolio projects. The video discusses enhancements and corrections that were implmented to the code prior to uploading my projects.
