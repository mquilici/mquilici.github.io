## Portfolio

Welcome to my github page. I am a computer science student and aspiring software developer. This page highlights some of the software projects that I have developed recently as part of my curriculum.<br/><br/>

### Mobile Application Development
[https://github.com/mquilici/Mobile-Weight-Tracker](https://github.com/mquilici/Mobile-Weight-Tracker)

The following project is an Android application that I developed to let users track their weight. A graph shows how the weights change over time. Users can set a goal weight or enter a height display their BMI. Their current BMI is then plotted on a BMI chart for comparison with standard ranges. Settings allow the user to change units from pounds to kilograms and enable dark mode.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
<p> coming soon... </p>
This project is a Java application that draws various platonic solids and other 3D objects. The program demonstrates the use of rotation matricies and projection matricies as well as lighting. A binary tree data structure is used to sort polygons by depth so that they can be drawn back to front.

### Databases
<p> coming soon... </p>

This project is a web dashboard that uses MongoDB and Plotly Dash to display shelter animals. Animals can be sorted by several categories using dropdown menus and their location is displayed on a map.
<br/>


### OpenGL

This project demonstrates OpenGL programming in C++ with texture mapping, normal mapping, and shadow mapping.
