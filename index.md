# Portfolio

Welcome to my github page. I am a computer science student and aspiring software developer. This page highlights some of the software projects that I have developed recently as part of my curriculum.<br/><br/>

## Software Design and Engineering

[https://github.com/mquilici/Mobile-Weight-Tracker](https://github.com/mquilici/Mobile-Weight-Tracker)

The following project is an Android application that I developed to let users track their weight. A graph shows how the weights change over time. Users can set a goal weight or enter a height to display their BMI. Their current BMI is then plotted on a BMI chart for comparison with standard ranges. Settings allow the user to change units from pounds to kilograms and enable dark mode.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
[https://github.com/mquilici/Java-3D-Shapes](https://github.com/mquilici/Java-3D-Shapes)

This project is a Java application that draws various platonic solids and other 3D objects. The program demonstrates the use of rotation matricies and projection matricies as well as lighting. A binary tree data structure is used to sort polygons by depth so that they can be drawn back to front.

## Databases
[https://github.com/mquilici/Web-Dashboard](https://github.com/mquilici/Web-Dashboard)

This project is a web dashboard that uses MongoDB and Plotly Dash to display shelter animals. Animals can be sorted by several categories using dropdown menus and their location is displayed on a map.

## Graphics

### OpenGL
[https://github.com/mquilici/OpenGL-Demo](https://github.com/mquilici/OpenGL-Demo)

This project demonstrates texture mapping, normal mapping, and shadow mapping techniques in OpenGL 3.3. I wrote custom vertex and fragment shaders that are responsible for transforming verticies from object space to screen space, computing phong lighting components (specular, diffuse, and ambient), and applying textures. I also wrote an object loader method that imports a 3D obj file containing vertex coordinates, normal vectors, and UV coordinates for each face.

### OpengGL
[https://github.com/mquilici/Fractal-OpenGL](https://github.com/mquilici/Fractal-OpenGL)

This project draws a 3D Mandelbrot fractal using OpenGL. The Mandelbrot set is typically depectied as a 2D image in the complex plane generated by the iterative equation z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c. Depending on the location, the iteration may converge to one value or oscillate between multiple values. To generate a "3D" mandelbrot fractal, the z values for the last several iterations are stored in an array for each pixel and then plotted. A interesting result of plotting the data in 3D is that real axis contains a classic bifurcation diagram .

## Security

This is my final cybersecurity presentation for CS-405. The presentation outlines the security policy for a fictional company called Green Pace and discusses coding best practices as well as security frameworks like defense-in-depth and Triple-A.
