### My Story

I am a software developer, inventor, and scientist with 11 years of experience in IoT devices, robotics, and software-controlled LED lighting. I have 20 patents in areas covering software controls, healthcare, and smart LED light sources. I have degrees in both software development and physics as well as a diverse skill set that includes embedded software, CAD, circuit design, optical design, and electronics testing. My degree in software development at Southern New Hampshire University has allowed me to build upon these skills to take my career to the next level. The program has showcased my strengths and has helped to shape my professional goals as a software developer. I gained valuable real-world skills and covered many important topics like collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and cybersecurity. This portfolio showcases my work in these areas.

### Subjects Areas

Collaboration: In my engineering career, I have successfully applied customer-driven development strategies, like Design Thinking, to invent and deliver innovative, award-winning products. At SNHU, I built upon these skills to develop software in a collaborative environment using Git code management solutions like Bitbucket and GitHub. I utilized Agile software development methodologies to translate stakeholder needs into user stories and iteratively improved software over multiple design sprints based on user feedback.

Data Structures and Algorithms: My coursework has strengthened my background in data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental to creating modern, efficient software. Using C++, I implemented binary search trees, hash tables, and linked lists as well as algorithms for storing, retrieving, and sorting data. These skills are demonstrated throughout my portfolio and show that I can successfully translate skills I learn in class to real-world projects.

Software Engineering: Throughout my coursework, I gained significant experience with object-oriented design in C++ and Java, mobile application development, Python, OpenGL, reverse engineering, and assembly language. Many of these skills are exemplified in the Android application included in my portfolio. The app follows object-oriented design with classes that implement user interaction with each of the UI screens and elements. To write the program, I used a model-view-controller design pattern.

Databases: SQL and NoSQL database services like MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB were used extensively throughout many courses. I learned how to create and administer databases and integrate databases into coding projects like the web dashboard and Android application shown in my project portfolio.

Cybersecurity: Our modern digital infrastructure is the target of frequent attacks. Criminals are trying to break into networks, steal sensitive data, and sell it on the dark web. The cybersecurity course covers secure coding standards in C++ as well as security frameworks like defense-in-depth and Triple-A.

### Descrition

The projects in my portfolio illustrate skills I developed while completing my degree. These projects are categorized as Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, Databases, Computer Graphics, and Cybersecurity. In the Software Design and Engineering category, I developed an Android application for users to record and plot their weights over time. The app demonstrates my ability to take a project from concept through to completion. I started by researching what features users would like in a fitness app. I then created sketches for the interface to include those features. Lastly, I coded the program using a model-view-controller design pattern.

The Algorithms and Design category includes a Java program I wrote to draw interactive 3D objects. The program demonstrates the use of binary trees, rotation matrices, perspective projection, and lighting calculations. Binary trees store object faces based on their distance from the camera and an in-order traversal is used to draw the objects back to front. Lighting calculations including ambient, diffuse, and specular components are applied to add realism.

The Databases category includes a web dashboard I created using MongoDB and Python. The dashboard loads data for shelter animals from a MongoDB database and displays the information in a table. Dropdown menus interact with callback methods to query the database for various animal characteristics like type, breed, and gender. An age range slider further refines results by setting the minimum and maximum ages displayed. A map shows the geographic location for each of the animals and a pie chart shows the distribution of breeds shown in the table.

The Computer Graphics category includes two OpenGL projects. The first project demonstrates the use of texture mapping, normal mapping, and shadow mapping. Objects are illuminated using the Phong model with ambient, diffuse, and specular components. Normal mapping modifies the surface normals at each fragment location to give the impression that the surface is bumpy. Shadow mapping renders the scene twice: once to create a depth map from the perspective of the light source, and a second time from the perspective of the camera to compute which parts of the scene are occluded by objects and are in shadow.

Lastly, the Cybersecurity category includes a final presentation for my class on cybersecurity. In the presentation, I discuss the security policy for a fictitious company called Green Pace and go over secure coding standards and best practices that can help reduce security vulnerabilities. I cover topics like defense-in-depth and the Triple-A framework for improving the security of the organization. I also provide examples in C++ that demonstrate vulnerabilities like buffer overflow, numeric overflow, and SQL injection. Additional examples cover methods for encryption, the use of exceptions, static analysis, and unit testing with Google Test.
