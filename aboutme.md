My name is Michael Quilici and I am currently a software engineering student.

### My story

I am a scientist and inventor with over a decade of experience working in R&D for a prominent opto-semiconductor manufacturer. Much of my work involves mechanical design and circuit design of IoT devices and smart LED light sources. Now, I am embarking on a new path to become a software developer.
